About the code
--------------

This site is hosted on Github using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). The code is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an open source static site generator, using content stored in markdown files. Upon deployment, Github runs the code through Jekyll's processing to generate and deploy the static HTML site.

CSS is generated using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), an open source CSS preprocessor.

JavaScript is processed through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert modern ECMAScript code to a more broadly supported syntax.
